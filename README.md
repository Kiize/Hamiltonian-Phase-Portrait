# Hamiltonian-Phase-Portrait

This is a code to plot Hamiltonian field from a given Hamiltonian.
That's all :)

In the folder you will find a jupyter code, a pyhton code and some plots of known Hamiltonian like the pendulum's one.

If you see errors or you want to ask anything, feel free to contact me.
